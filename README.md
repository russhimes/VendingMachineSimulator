## Module 1 Capstone - Vending Machine Software

During this project I worked with two other Tech Elevator students to create a simulated vending machine.  The vending machine reads in its contents from a file, keeps track of how many of each item is remaining, and displays their prices.  A user can insert money and spend that money to buy any item in the machine.  The app prints a custom message depending on the type of snack purchased.

Our group also wrote an audit log, a text file that tracks each purchase.
